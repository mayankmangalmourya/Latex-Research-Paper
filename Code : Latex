\footnotesize There is no doubt that access use of Google search has changed gradually over past few years. Whenever we found any answer of question . The first think that comes in our mind, “Google”, In this smart phones era, today’s teenagers , student  asking Google to find information on any kind of question. But one doubt comes here that “ is Google actually help in improving learning skills, or it will effect our Learning power.
\\    According to Science It’s clearly said that when we try to do thing by ourselves, It does exercise our brain, increases Concentration Power, increase thinking skills on finding new way to solve the problem.

\section{Background, Preliminary, and Related Work}

Internet and its uses create a more anxious picture in our mind. first thought says it's boost up our knowledge while another said it reduces thinking skills. During Research it will had be seen that students who use browsing technology extremely are less motivate towards their study and are more anxious about exam tests, Due to this worry, it effect's was made worse by the increased feelings of loneliness 
\\ In Year 2015, Approx, 94 percent of children ages 3 to 18 had a computer at home and 61 percent of children ages 3 to 18 had internet access at home. The percentages of children having computer and internet access at home in 2015 were more for children who were teenagers, those whose parents had higher levels of educational attainment, and those whose families had higher incomes. Also, higher percentages of children who were White (66 percent), Asian (63 percent), and of Two or more races (64 percent) had home internet access in 2015 than did Black (53 percent), Hispanic (52 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native children (49 percent).
\\For those children who had access to the Internet in 2015, the two locations with the highest reported levels of internet access were at home (86 percent) and at school (65 percent), and the two most common means of internet access at home were a high-speed internet service and a mobile internet service or data plan. 
\\In 2015, about 88 percent of 8th-graders and 83 percent of 4th-graders reported that they used a computer at home, and 80 percent of 8th-graders reported using a computer for schoolwork on a weekday. The percentages of students using a computer at home and using a computer for schoolwork varied by student and family characteristics. 
\\While in 2020-21 Teenagers are more close towards technical world and they want to reduce time and doing smart work but I think they don’t know that it will damage their learning skills. It will result more and more patients of eye defects, mental diseases etc.

\section{Method}

According to KFF, a full 21 percent of teens are defined as major media users who spend more than 16 hours a day with the media. Another 63 percent is defined as moderate users who use the media for 3-16 hours a day. Teens who fall into the category of light users are those who use the media for less than 3 hours a day.

In those media hours, the internet now takes about half the time. For many children and adolescents their online use is well-regulated as they balance media use with school, sports, friends, and other commitments. Yet for a small percentage of teens, the need to be online can be compulsory, uncontrollable, or pathological, this type of misbehavior is sometimes referred to as online 'addiction'.

Whether compulsory internet use falls into the legal category of addiction or not, there is clear evidence that some users develop a compulsive online presence that interferes with their daily activities, relationships and health2. Although researchers are far from fully understanding the causal relationship between the use of the Internet and misbehavior (and to the extent that these relationships may work in both ways), evidence suggests that the risk for teens from developing these problems is much higher than for adults. users\\

I am doing survey of lower, high, and collage level students , I am doing research between 100 student in group , in which “I asked to student that, “if I were give you question and said that you all have to found answer  of that question with in 2 min how to found it, mostly student said, By using Google. Then I again said that if I were give you ten min and now you have to found answer of question with the help of books , then people say’s, “It is waste of our time, if we have web browsing then why we go with books .
\\Above statement clearly state that Mostly student are not interested with books, 
Student think that without web browsing they have to go with unwanted material but, according to my view it gives us idea by which we are not doing that work it does encourage student to know more concepts regarding that topic and increases the learning skills.

\subsection{Internet Usage}

the usage of internet is deliver us. An Important details around world. it is one big plateform of several type of information. Internet usage will continue to grow as long as its users are not denied easy access. Recent statistics indicates that the internet gives people the option to access information sites as well as the other sites such as social media , gamming, cyber-sex. thus its like a broaden thir academic knolwedge.

\subsection{Time Spend on the i-Internet}
it has been recently reported that adolescents spend a signigicant amount of their time on the internet for multiple purpose. Evidence says that excess use of browsing create problems in our daily routines, school performance and family relationship.

\section{Finding and Discussion.}

\begin{enumerate}

\subsection{Adolescent Internet Abuse: A Study on the Role of Attachment to Parents and Peers in a Large Community Sample}
Young people are big users of new technologies and their main purpose is to use social media. While the new technology is useful for young people, in managing its development activities, recent studies have shown that it can be a barrier to its growth. Studies show that teens who are addicted to the Internet find low quality in their relationships with parents and individual difficulties. However, limited research is available on the role that adolescents play in the adherence of parents and peers, taking into account their psychological profiles. We examined a large sample of young people () of Internet use / abuse, teen adherence to parents and peers, and their psychological profiles. A hierarchical retrospective analysis was performed to confirm the impact of parental and peer attachment on cyberbullying / abuse, taking into account the moderate outcome of adolescent psychopathological risk. The results showed that adolescent attachment to parents greatly influenced the use of the Internet. The psychopathological risk of adolescents has had a moderate effect on the relationship between maternal attachment and online use. Our research shows that more research is needed, taking into account both individual and family variables.\\
\subsection{Overall Observation}
    Here we found that in actually it does effect our brain . above mention reports and paragraph highlight that "giving ourself more to Internet Browsing lead to loss the thinking power" 
Now we can say that Internet use in appropriate manner will make every one future but its excessness were be very dangerous not at that time but in future.
Research result shown that, those student use web browsing technique his/ her IQ level is down as compared to those who preferred books
In discussion, we have to pay attention regarding our IQ level , conceptual things etc which help to maintain our brain level otherwise excess use of browsing will wash our brain .\\
Now, one question comes here : - Why do college students prefer to use the Internet to do research instead of library research? Answer is 1. In India, universities and institutions do not have all the research journals relevant to each field. Although, they have subscribed to a major Internet site. So they prefer to use an online search.
2. Another reason I can think of is related to the quality of research as a result from here. Often many recent research journals have been published in India, which are false and have no guarantees to support them. So young students or researchers often go through the flow and refer to online sources to collect secondary data and books.
3. The importance of research is not focused on students from affiliated institutions and for them getting a degree or a job is very important.

\section{Conclusion}

The availability of different internet source to students will grant all of them immediate access. the various senior high schools are not resourceful enough to grant internet access to student. Despite the alternatives to school based internet, access to internet among senior high school student is still limited. but access to internet source will promoting academics performance among students since those with access showed were improved more improvement in academic performance than those without access but they were use this in proper manner means only for academic purpose. however different uses of internet
